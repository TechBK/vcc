“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python.
However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. spam)
should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member).
It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice. ndsmf
